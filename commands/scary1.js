    ` **Cultured Oija Board**
    > In high school my friends and I were messing around with a Ouija board one night.
    > We had done it before and nothing remarkable had ever happened.
    > We usually did it to try and scare each other or are girlfriends.
    > We all thought it was a joke.
    > That night there was no one else home except the 7 of us and we were all together around the board. 
    > One of the girls there wanted to try it. She had never done it before. 

    > This time was different. The board misspelled some of the words the same way every time. 
    > It gave answers that seemed really historically accurate for our town (things we neither knew or cared about). 
    > Long story short, the “spirit” claimed it was a 10 year old boy who had died on the property in the 1800s 
    > and was buried there too in an unmarked grave (my friends house was on a farm in the edge of town). 
    > We were all a little freaked out because the board had never been so detailed and consistent. 
    > However, we were still skeptical and we were all assuming one of us was trying to scare the rest.
    
    > Finally, my friend asked if the spirit could do something to prove he was there with us. 
    > It went to Yes and then spelled out k-n-o-c-k. Then the planchette stopped moving. 
    > We just all stared at it silently and then there was a rap-rap-rap on the window right next to us. 
    > The lights were on outside and there was absolutely no one out there.
    > We never touched that f-ing board again.
